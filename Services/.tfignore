#You can configure which kinds of files are ignored by placing a text file called .tfignore in the folder 
#where you want rules to apply. The effects of the .tfignore file are recursive. 
#However, you can create .tfignore files in sub-folders to override the effects of a .tfignore file in a parent folder.

The following rules apply to a .tfignore file:
# begins a comment line
# The * and ? wildcards are supported.
# A filespec is recursive unless prefixed by the \ character.
# ! negates a filespec (files that match the pattern are not ignored)

# Ignore the NuGet packages folder in the root of the repository.
# If needed, prefix 'packages' with additional folder names if it's not in the same folder as .tfignore.
packages

# include package target files which may be required for msbuild, again prefixing the folder name as needed.
!packages/*.targets


# Ignore .cpp files in the ProjA sub-folder and all its subfolders
#ProjA\*.cpp

# Ignore .txt files in this folder 
\*.txt

# Ignore .xml files in this folder and all its sub-folders
#*.xml
*.App.config
*.appsettings.json

# Ignore all files in the Temp sub-folder
Igmite.Lighthouse.Services\Documents
Igmite.Lighthouse.Services\Reports
Igmite.Lighthouse.Services\Keys
Igmite.Lighthouse.Services\Logs
Igmite.Lighthouse.Services\wwwroot

# Do not ignore .dll files in this folder nor in any of its sub-folders
#!*.dll
